# Scripts

A collection of useful scripts that I have written.

+ [Site Generation Script](gen_site.pl): Builds personal site from a collection of markdown files.
+ [Markdown Heading Refactor](md_refactor.pl): Recursively standardizes the spacing between markdown pound sign headings and the heading content.
+ [NIS DokuWiki Password Syncing](wiki_passwd.pl): Syncs NIS password hashes with a Dokuwiki instance for SSO like behavior.
+ [Batch Remote Host Script](shotgun.sh): A simple script that SPCs a directory to a list of remote host and then executes an included shell script.
